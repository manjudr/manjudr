### Hi there, I'm Manjunath DavanamðŸ‘‹

I am a polyglot programmer with a deep passion for building scalable platforms that drive real-world impact. Currently, I'm leading the development of **Obsrv**, an advanced data pipeline product that is set to redefine how organizations handle data processing and analytics.

In my career, I have also built platforms across multiple domains. Iâ€™ve contributed to the development of an [**Indian Digital Learning Platform**](https://sunbird.org), a transformative initiative that provides education to millions of students, and Iâ€™ve worked on solutions for the agriculture sector, creating technology to support farmers with seeds and crop protection.

Beyond platform development, Iâ€™m a strong advocate for open-source software, both as an active contributor and maintainer. The open-source community has played a crucial role in my growth, and Iâ€™m committed to giving back through collaboration and knowledge sharing. My mission is to continue building platforms that solve complex challenges and contribute to the greater good.
