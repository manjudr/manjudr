- **[Agriculture Tech Solution](https://www.syngenta-us.com)s**: Architecting innovative technologies to support farmers in crop protection, sustainable farming practices, and maximizing yield efficiency.

- **[Obsrv](obsrv.sunbird.org)**: Spearheading the development of **Obsrv**, an advanced data pipeline product that optimizes data processing workflows, empowering organizations to efficiently manage large-scale datasets and gain actionable insights in real-time.

As a **quick learner**, I thrive on tackling new challenges and mastering emerging technologies. My expertise spans **system architecture**, **debugging complex systems**, **containerization**, **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**, and **performance benchmarking**. I am committed to delivering end-to-end solutions that are not only scalable but also resilient and reliable.
